# Week 6 - Arrays

### Learning Outcomes
- Learning arrays in programming
- Practising array operatios
- Using loops in arrays

## Lab

Here is the rainfall data recorded at the Dublin Airport over 12 months of 2010:

| Month | Amount in mm |
|-------|--------------|
| Jan | 45 |
| Feb | 37 |
| March | 55 |
| April | 27 |
| May | 38 |
| June | 50 |
| July | 79 |
| August | 48 |
| September | 104 |
| October | 31 |
| November | 100 |
| December | 58 |

Create a Processing sketch and do the following:

- Allocate two arrays for storing the month names and the rainfall data
- Calculate the average rainfall for that year
- Calculate the month with the highest rainfall
- Calculate the month with the lowest rainfall

Now see if you can write code to generate the following graphs of the rainfall data:

- A bar chart:

  ![Sketch](images/p37.png)

  Start by drawing the axis, then draw the ticks and print the text, then draw the bars. You can use ```textAlign(CENTER, CENTER)``` to align the text
  Use the HSB color space to assign different colors to each bar

- A trend line:

	![Sketch](images/p38.png)

  This one is a bit trickier because you have to calculate the start xy and end xy for each line. Your for loop for drawing the trend lines can start at 1 instead of 0 and then you can get the previous value for the start of each line by taking rainfall[i - 1].

- A pie chart 

	![Sketch](images/p39.png)

	You can use the the [arc function](https://processing.org/reference/arc_.html) to draw arcs and sin & cos to calculate the x and y coordinates to print the text. This one is the most challenging. Remember that a pie chart shows the proportion of each data point in the sum of all the data, so you will have to calculate the sum of all the rain fall and figure out how much each month is relative to the sum. It's best to draw the segments first and then draw the labels. Your map function might look something like this:

	```Java
	float angle = map(rainfall[i], 0, sum, 0, TWO_PI);
	```


# Week 5 - Loops

### Learning Outcomes
- Using loops in programming: while loop, for loop
- Learning nested loops
- Creating and drawing funky sketches
- A very good [tutorial](https://csee.bangor.ac.uk/project-rainbow/create-a-coloured-grid-in-processing/) on creating a coloured grid (by Jonathan)

## Lab
[Loop Practice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R8eRS-vLJVhUp5U5irNQOG5nbvKlVaPu/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113463557400115436734&rtpof=true&sd=true)
(Reference: Retrieved from previous year's lab in [this link](https://github.com/skooter500/GP-2020-2021))
- Task 1: Simple sketches
- Task 2: Nested loops
- Task 3: Some crazy stuff


# Week 4 - Conditional

### Learning Outcomes
- Learn conditional syntaxes and operators: boolean expressions, relational operators, if-else statements, logical operators
- Use conditional programming in sketches

## Lab
[Conditional operations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eRqL4RBA9pwyj7L8jQEhiJVpbvoIfGiP/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113463557400115436734&rtpof=true&sd=true)
- Task 1: Changing window colour
- Task 2: Moving a rectangle across window
- Task 3: A simple rollover
- Task 4: Fading colour
- Task 5: Moving a ball across window using Boolean variables
- Task 6: A bouncing ball (step-by-step addition conditions)

# Week 3 - Using variables and trigonometric functions
- [Trigonometry problem set](https://1.cdn.edl.io/IDqRlI8C9dRkoqehbbdHBrcGT6m87gkCQuMKTkp0U7JvHvuG.pdf)

## Lab
### Learning Outcomes
- Use numeric variables in a sketch
- Use operatorts on variables
- Use trigonometry
- Make beautiful things

A person flying a kite has released 176m of string. The string makes an angle of 27Â° with the ground. How high is the kite? How far away is the kite horizontally?

Write a processing sketch sketch to draw and solve the problem.
  - Solve the problem on paper first
  - Make variables for stringLen, theta, kHeight, kDist and any other variables you need
  - Assign the values that you know to the variables
  - Write code to calculate the kith height and horizontal distance values
  - Write code to draw the scenario

![image](images/p28.png)

You can use the function [text](https://processing.org/reference/text_.html) to print text to the screen and [nf](https://processing.org/reference/nf_.html) to format a number to a certain number of dp's. For example ```text("Price: " + nf(p, 10, 2), 10, 50)```. You can look these functions up in the Processing reference.

### Part 2 - Spiral Jam

Experiment with the spirals sketch and see what kind of crazy beautiful spirals you can make. Use variables for colour gradients, use different shapes etc etc.

# Week 2 - Using variables
### Learning Outcomes
- Practice drawing
- Learn how to use operators with variables

# Part 1

Here is a youtube video of 4 sketches you can program today:

[![YouTube](http://img.youtube.com/vi/kPOFqXsLLeo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPOFqXsLLeo)

In your solution use the following processing functions:
- fill
- rect
- ellipse
- background
- stroke
- noStroke

And the mouseX and mouseY varibles. You can also use the + - * / operators

# Part 2

[![YouTube](http://img.youtube.com/vi/uvPVGiU-bn4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvPVGiU-bn4)

What is happening:

- The ground takes up half the window size
- The spaceship is 100 pixels wide and is *centered* around the mouse position.
- The person starts at the right side of the screen and moved from right to left

Use variables wherever practical in your sketch and calculate positions and sizes relative to these variables.

Bonus!

There are few things you can try (but you will probably have to read ahead and figure out how the if statement works)

- Come up with a more beautiful looking spaceship and person
- Change the colours of everything
- Make a car that drives from left to right
- When the person reaches the left side of the screen, he should switch direction
- Make the lights on the spaceship flash different colours
